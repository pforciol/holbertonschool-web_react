# 0x05 - React inline styling

At the end of this project, I'm expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- The differences between using a CSS file and inline styling
- How to use a CSS-in-JS tool like Aphrodite
- How to use conditions within JS to apply different styles
- How to use responsive design and make the application show a different UI according to the screen size
- How to create small animations within the app
