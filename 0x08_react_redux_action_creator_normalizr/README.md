At the end of this project, I'm expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- Normalizrâ€™s purpose and how to use it
- Schemas and normalization of nested JSON
- Core concepts of Redux
- Redux actions
- Redux action creators
- Async actions in Redux
- How to write tests for Redux
